## Title: E-Waste Facility Locator: Building a Sustainable Solution
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
Overview Ideas:
This workshop aims to empower participants to develop an E-Waste Facility Locator platform that helps users locate nearby e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Participants will learn about the importance of proper e-waste disposal, explore the technology stack required for building the platform, and work on hands-on exercises to prototype and develop key features.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
Develop a user-friendly web application and mobile app that utilizes geolocation to display a map of nearby e-waste facilities. Users can search for facilities based on their location or specific criteria such as accepted materials or operating hours. The platform will also provide educational resources about the importance of e-waste recycling and the environmental impacts of improper disposal. Additionally, users can track their e-waste recycling history and earn rewards or incentives for participating in responsible disposal practices.
